Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves the initial examination and visualization of a dataset to understand its main characteristics, identify patterns, discover anomalies, and generate hypotheses. EDA is typically performed before any formal statistical or machine learning modeling and helps data analysts and scientists get a better grasp of the data they are working with. 
Here are the key steps and techniques involved in EDA:
- Data Collection
- Summary Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Data Transformation
- Handling Missing Values
- Outlier Detections
- Feature Engineering
- Correlation Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
- Interactive Exploration
- Documentation
- Communication
EDA is an iterative process, and the insights gained from it can influence subsequent steps in data analysis or machine learning, such as feature selection, model choice, and evaluation metrics. It's a crucial foundation for making data-driven decisions and drawing meaningful conclusions from your data.
